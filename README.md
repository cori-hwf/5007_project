# Getting Started with Our IT5007 Movie System Project

### To run the project, you need to:
#### For the frontend:

     cd frontend
     npm install 
     npm start
Then go to `localhost:3000`


#### For the backend:

     cd backend
     npm install 
     npm start
For graphql testing go to `localhost:8081/graphql`

* set up database: we used mongodb atlas(the cloud version of mongodb); The connection can be found in backend -> app.js The current setup will be connected to personal mongodb cluster and we have set the access right to public. Hence, there shall be no need for the TA to set up database but use the current set up directly. However, should there be any connection error, please change the link to your own mongodb cluster.(ref to sign up mongodb atlas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPqRyYJmx2g )

* npm start Note: if there is any error for npm start, remove the node_modules & package-lock.json folders and redo npm install
